# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and others) working in Unto Caesar.

## What this project is

Open-source tax filing on safe, trusted local AI. It is for individuals, families, small and large businesses, and volunteers or institutions (universities, community hubs) filing for others. It runs as a desktop app, a self-hosted site with no GUI, or across shared compute nodes, and it prepares returns, finds deductions, tracks local, state and federal deadlines, and keeps everything encrypted.

## Ground rules

- **Local first, compute via Fonsviva.** Features must work with local models on the user's own hardware. All compute, including RunPod and other cloud providers, comes via [Fonsviva](https://github.com/baney75/Fonsviva). This app never adds providers, stores provider keys or calls a cloud provider itself. It connects to Fonsviva and shows where each job ran. Cloud providers are personal use only and are set up in Fonsviva.
- **Private and secure by default.** User data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Never log, print or send secrets or personal data.
- **Trusted models only.** Use safe, reputable open models. Document which models a feature was tested with.
- **Easy beats clever.** Every feature has to be usable by a non-technical person.
- **Design comes from DESIGN.md.** Follow it for all UI work. If it is empty or silent on something, ask the designer rather than inventing a style.
- **Prove it works.** Back every change with behavior tests or a recorded real run. Don't claim something works without evidence.
- **Small, reviewable changes.** One concern per pull request, with a clear description.
- **Tax accuracy is the product.** Tax rules belong in skills and tested code, never in model guesses. Cite the official source (IRS, state, local) for every rule.
- **A human signs.** The app prepares returns; a person reviews and submits them.

## Install and setup (for agents setting this up for a person)

> **Status: planned, not released.** UntoCaesar has no release yet, so there is nothing to install today. These steps are the target behavior. Each one becomes true only when its test in [TESTING.md](https://github.com/baney75/UntoCaesar/blob/main/TESTING.md) passes, and [SUPPORTED.md](https://github.com/baney75/UntoCaesar/blob/main/SUPPORTED.md) is the source of truth for what works now. An agent must check SUPPORTED.md first and tell the person plainly if a step isn't supported yet.

Follow [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) ([web](https://baney75.github.io/UntoCaesar/agents)). In short:

1. **Install:** [docs/setup/install.md](docs/setup/install.md). Check: `fonsviva status` prints `Fonsviva <version> running at http://127.0.0.1:7341`.
2. **Connect to Fonsviva:** [docs/setup/connect-fonsviva.md](docs/setup/connect-fonsviva.md). Check: `fonsviva keys list` shows `untocaesar` as `active`.
3. **Select models:** [docs/setup/select-models.md](docs/setup/select-models.md). Check: `fonsviva models list --app untocaesar` shows the chosen models with gates `pass`.
4. **Cloud (optional, personal only):** [docs/setup/add-cloud-provider.md](docs/setup/add-cloud-provider.md). Only in Fonsviva. Ask the person first.
5. **If anything fails:** [docs/setup/troubleshoot.md](docs/setup/troubleshoot.md) and `fonsviva doctor`.

Ask before installing anything or spending money, never print keys, and never try to get around the cloud block. Machine-readable index: [llms.txt](llms.txt).

## Skills

Skills live in `skills/maintainer/` (for building this project) and `skills/runtime/` (used by agents inside the app). All are original and tested; see `skills/README.md`. Load the skill that matches your task before starting, and improve it when you learn something.

## Testing and honesty

Never claim the software can do something without a passing test. Follow `TESTING.md`, keep `SUPPORTED.md` honest, and benchmark models per `BENCHMARKS.md`. Model-specific instructions live in `models/<model>/`.

## Releases

Unto Caesar ships on two channels, Stable and Dev (no nightly). See `RELEASES.md`. Never push directly to `stable`.
